# Power Analysis Project
This project contains 3 folder: Datasets, Figures and R_files

The R_files folder just contains Main.R where all the codes are and Functions.R containing the codes

# Research Goals

The project aims to
1. estimate effect sizes and power at various OTU abundances in microbiome differential abundance studies
that are based on the Negative Binomial Models.

2. estimate the estimated number of OTUs in a differential abundance studies that the null hypothesis can be rejects.(ie, that can be declared as having significant difference between groups)

3. estimate sample sizes needed to detect a given effect size and power
