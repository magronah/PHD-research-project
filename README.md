# Power Analysis Project
This project contains 3 folder: Datasets, Figures and R_files

The R_files folder contains Main.R where all the codes are and Functions.R containing functions used

# Research Goals

The project aims to
1. estimate effect sizes and power at various OTU abundances in differential abundance microbiome studies
based on the Negative Binomial Model.

2. estimate the expected number of OTUs in a differential abundance studies for which the null hypothesis can be rejected (ie, the expected number of OTUs  that can be declared as having significant differences between groups).

3. estimate sample sizes needed to detect a given effect size and power.
